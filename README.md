# Travelling-Salesman-Problem

## Introduction

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that allows a salesman to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point.

Finding a solution to the TSP would change the face of the earth, it would : 
- Drastically enhance Public Transport routes, such as Metro and Tram lines
- Greatly optimize Network Routing, leading to much faster internet
- Simplify tourism as the travel experience would be far more efficient 
- Revolutionize Supply Chain Management as a whole in all domains

However, as of today, it remains a NP-complete problem, meaning no algorithm in polynomial time complexity exists as a solution to these problem.
To illustrate the problem, let's imagine an itinary between 10 cities, using an algorithm which finds all possible combination between all cities, it would take about 0.2 seconds. However, 15 cities would require more than 12 hours of calculation and for 25 cities, it would exceed the age of the universe.

In this study, we will be comparing two approches of the TSP problem : a comprehensive approach and a "Ant colony optimization" approach.
